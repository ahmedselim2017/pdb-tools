Selects atoms according to their B-factor value.

Valid Operations:
    [g] - greater than
    [l] - less than
    [e] - equal to
    [n] - not equal to

Usage:
    python pdb_selb.py -<operators> -treshold <pdb file>

Example:
    python pdb_selb.py -g -10 1CTF.pdb  # selects atoms with B-factor greater than 10
    python pdb_selb.py -l -10 1CTF.pdb  # selects atoms with B-factor less than 10
    python pdb_selb.py -ge -10 1CTF.pdb # selects atoms with B-factor greater or equal to 10
    python pdb_selb.py -le -10 1CTF.pdb # selects atoms with B-factor less or equal to 10
    python pdb_selb.py -e -10 1CTF.pdb  # selects atoms with B-factor equal to 10
    python pdb_selb.py -n -10 1CTF.pdb # selects atoms with B-factor not equal to 10

This program is part of the `pdb-tools` suite of utilities and should not be
distributed isolatedly. The `pdb-tools` were created to quickly manipulate PDB
files using the terminal, and can be used sequentially, with one tool streaming
data to another. They are based on old FORTRAN77 code that was taking too much
effort to maintain and compile. RIP.
